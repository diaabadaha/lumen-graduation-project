"""
Unit tests for the Object Allocation guidance policy (GuidanceTracker).

The tracker is the brain of the detection loop: temporal consistency (3-of-5),
throttled re-speaking, the scan / lost / timeout edges. It takes an injected
clock (``now``), so we can drive a scripted sequence of frames deterministically
without a real model, real audio, or real time.

Frame is 640x480 throughout. Detections are hand-built yolo_service.Detection
objects positioned to land in known region/distance buckets.

Run with::

    cd backend && python -m pytest tests/test_object_allocation.py
