"""All mutable navigation state, one instance per Session.

The webdemo prototype kept this as module-level globals (single user). Integrated
into the backend, every connected user gets their own :class:`NavState`, created by
the navigation engine when the FSM enters ``NavigationActive`` and thrown away when
the task ends. The other navigation modules receive it as their first ``st``
argument and index it like the original dict (``st["mode"]``), so their decision
logic is unchanged from the field-tested prototype.

Contents:
  - the phase dict (``st[...]``) — the exploration FSM's single source of truth
  - ``scan_counts`` — indicator-class hit counts for the CURRENT room
  - ``door_hist``  — rolling (region, distance) of the strongest door, per frame
  - ``prev_small`` — last downscaled grayscale frame, for motion gating

The ``enter_*`` methods are the only sanctioned way to switch phase — they reset
the fields that phase depends on.

Two-pass, single-concern exploration so prompts never override each other:
  discover     -> Pass 1: ONE instruction, then scan SILENTLY for a full sweep,
                  accumulating two flags: indicator_ok and door_seen.
  go_indicator -> Pass 2a (chosen when indicator_ok): re-confirm the goal's
                  objects, then announce arrival. Beats doors.
  face_target  -> Pass 2 opener: rotate the user to face the chosen door/indicator.
  go_door      -> Pass 2b (chosen when only door_seen): locate + guide to a door.
  arrived      -> terminal; the arrival line is spoken and the journey ends.
Walking through a near door resets us to discover for the new room.

Key fields (see the prototype's docs for the full story):
  mode       : current phase
  scan_age   : usable (non-blurred) frames spent in the current scan
  phase_age  : paces spoken re-prompts (detection runs ~3x/s)
  near_latch : we got right up to a door (it filled the view)
  gone       : cycles with no door since near_latch -> infer we walked through
  door_seen  : a door was confirmed at some point during the current discover
  ref_heading: compass heading (deg) the user faced when this scan began = "ahead"
  last_heading / net_rotation: track cumulative turn to know when 360 is done
  covered    : set of 30-deg sector indices the turn has passed through
  milestones : which progress lines were already spoken
  sector_objs: {sector -> Counter of detected classes (incl 'door')} for the summary
  door_bearings: absolute compass headings (deg) where a door was seen, each
                 corrected by the door's horizontal position in the frame. Clustered
                 at scan-end so ONE physical door = one target (not one per sector).
