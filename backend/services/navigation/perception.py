"""The perception layer: one camera frame -> trustworthy detections.

Pipeline per frame (called in this order by the server):
  1. perceive_objects  — COCO indicators (+ obstacle classes while walking), with the
                         whole-frame "wall latch" gate.
  2. process_doors     — the door stack: geometry gates -> 4-class semantic
                         verification -> fridge arbitration -> cross-model de-confusion.
  3. build_boxes       — normalize everything kept into overlay boxes + a `seen` set.
  4. door_geometry     — the strongest door's bearing/distance + 2-of-3 confirmation.

Everything here is about *what is in the frame*; deciding what to DO with it (and what
to say) is the controller's job.
