Reach guidance: turn (target box, fingertip) into a hand-relative direction.

Once Object Allocation has located the target and the user is within arm's
reach, the user reaches with their free hand. Their reaching hand enters the
camera frame from below. We compute the vector from the index fingertip to
the target's box centroid in pixel space and decide what to say:

    state       what's true                                       phrase
    ----------- ------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
    "approach"  finger is outside the box, far from centroid      "Move your hand left/right/up/down."
    "almost"    finger is outside the box but close to centroid    "Almost there. Reach forward."
    "touching"  fingertip is inside the box                        "Your hand is on the cup. Grasp it."

The touch case is what trips the auto-completion path: the loop fires
FSM ``task_complete`` and the task ends. That's the only autonomous task
exit in the system - the user can still stop earlier by saying "cancel".

Coordinate semantics
--------------------
The user is looking through the rear camera, so image-right == user's right
and "raise your hand" means moving the hand toward smaller y (up in image).
Frame origin is top-left.

Pure module: math only, no MediaPipe, no model. Unit-tested in isolation.
