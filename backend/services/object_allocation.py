"""
Object Allocation task (Sprint 3).

When the FSM enters ``ObjectAllocationActive``, :func:`start` spawns an asyncio
loop that, a few times per second:

    1. grabs the latest decoded camera frame off the session,
    2. runs YOLOv8n on it (in a thread, so the event loop keeps serving),
    3. keeps only detections of the requested target class,
    4. feeds the result to a :class:`GuidanceTracker`, which applies a
       temporal-consistency filter (target must appear in >= 3 of the last 5
       frames before we trust it), picks the most head-on instance, classifies
       direction + distance, and decides what (if anything) to say,
    5. speaks whatever phrase the tracker returns.

The decision logic lives in :class:`GuidanceTracker` - a pure, clock-injected
state machine with no I/O - so it can be unit-tested deterministically. The
async ``_run`` shell only does the I/O (frame grab, YOLO call, TTS, sleep).

Tracker outcomes:
    - ``("guide", phrase)``   normal directional guidance (throttled)
    - ``("scan",  phrase)``   periodic "slowly turn around" while never seen
    - ``("lost",  phrase)``   one announcement when a seen target drops out
    - ``("timeout", phrase)`` give up after never seeing it within 60 s

Completion is **user-driven**: the tracker never declares success. The user
says "got it" (handled in audio_handler -> FSM task_complete), which tears this
loop down via :func:`stop`. The only autonomous exit is the not-found timeout.
