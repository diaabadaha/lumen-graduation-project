Command parser.

Bridges raw Whisper transcriptions to FSM-ready intents:

    "find my cup"      ->  {"task_type": "object_allocation", "target": "cup", ...}
    "navigate kitchen" ->  {"task_type": "navigation",        "target": "kitchen", ...}
    "got it"           ->  {"task_type": "completion",        "target": "confirm", ...}
    "never mind"       ->  {"task_type": "completion",        "target": "cancel", ...}
    "what time is it"  ->  {"task_type": "unknown",            ...}

The "completion" task_type is recognized during an active task: a confirm
phrase ("got it", "found it") signals the user succeeded; a cancel phrase
("stop", "never mind") aborts. The FSM/audio layer decides whether the current
state actually accepts it - the parser only classifies the words.

Algorithm
---------
We try every possible (prefix, target) split of the input. For each split we
fuzzy-match the prefix to our list of supported templates and the target to
our list of supported nouns. The split with the best combined score wins.

This handles:
- Multi-word targets ("dining table", "living room")
- Mishearings ("cop" -> "cup", "fone" -> "phone", "microvave" -> "microwave")
- Slight phrasing variation ("find a cup" via "find" -> "find my")
- Trailing filler words ("find my cup, please" -> cup, dropping "please")

Thresholds are deliberately permissive (prefix >= 70, noun >= 60). False
positives at this layer are mostly fine because the worst case is that the
user hears a wrong confirmation TTS and tries again.

Designed to be standalone and importable - run from a Python REPL.
