"""
Lumen task FSM.

Five states, deterministic transitions, no autonomous transitions. Every
transition is driven by an explicit event from outside (a user gesture, a
recognized voice command, a task completion signal, or a cancellation).

States
------
- ``Idle``                 : no active task, awaiting user
- ``ListeningForCommand``  : user pressed Start, captured a PTT recording, waiting for parse
- ``ObjectAllocationActive`` : object-allocation task in progress
- ``NavigationActive``       : navigation task in progress
- ``ReturningToIdle``        : transitional state - cleaning up before returning to Idle

Events
------
- ``user_start``        : Idle → ListeningForCommand
- ``user_stop``         : any active state → ReturningToIdle (i.e. end the
                           whole session - this is what the UI Stop button
                           fires)
- ``command_recognized`` : ListeningForCommand → ObjectAllocationActive | NavigationActive,
                           depending on payload['task_type']
- ``command_unknown``   : ListeningForCommand → ListeningForCommand (no-op, for symmetry)
- ``task_complete``     : Object/Nav/Returning → ReturningToIdle → Idle
- ``task_abort``        : Object/Nav → ListeningForCommand (cancel the current
                           task but stay in the session, ready for the next
                           voice command - this is what voice "cancel" fires)
- ``cleanup_done``      : ReturningToIdle → Idle (caller signals cleanup is done)

Subscribers
-----------
``subscribe(callback)`` registers a callable that will be invoked on every
state change with ``(old_state, new_state)``. Used by Session to push
``fsm_state`` JSON to the client.
