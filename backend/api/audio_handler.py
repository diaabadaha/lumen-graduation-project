"""
Push-to-talk audio handler.

Receives binary `command_audio` messages (WebM/Opus blobs from the browser's
MediaRecorder), runs them through:

    speech_service.transcribe()  →  command_parser.parse()  →  FSM event
                                                                      ↓
                              tts_service.synthesize()  ←  confirmation phrase
                                          ↓
                                   send_tts() back to client

The full integration glue is in this file (matches Sprint 1's "voice round-trip"
goal). The blob is also saved to backend/captured_audio/<timestamp>.webm for
offline inspection.
